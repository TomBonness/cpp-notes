## Ch. 2.1 - Introduction to Functions
- a **function** is a reusable series of statements designed to do a paticular task
  - **user defined functions** are created by the user and not part of a library
  - a **function call** interrupts the current function and calls another
  - the **function header** is the first line that tells the compiler the function exists
    - *returnType functionName()*
  - the **function body** is everything inside the brackets { function body }
  - a function must be defined BEFORE it is called
  - c++ does not support **nested functions**
    - cannot define a function inside of another function, but you can call it


## Ch 2.2 - Function Return Values
- **return type** the type defined before the functionname that determines the type it will return
- **return value** is what is returned back to the caller
- requirements for main()
  - must return an **int**
  - cannot explicitly make a function call to main()
  - generally (not always) main should be the last function in the file
