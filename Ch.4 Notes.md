# Chapter 4 - Fundamental Data Types

## Ch. 4.0 - Introduction to Fundamental Data Types
- a **binary digit** or **bit** is the smallest unit of memory
  - holds a value of 1 or 0
- a **memory address** is an organized sequence of units 
  - each memory address holds 1 byte of data (8 bits)
- the **type** tells the compiler how to interperate the memory byte meaningfully
- an **integral** means 'like an integer'
  - **integral types** in C++ are **bool**
- an **integer** is a number with no decimal or fractional part, includes +/-/0
  - **standard integer types** in C++ are **short**, **int**, **long**, and **long long**
